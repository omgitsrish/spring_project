Git pull and push commands
git clone url : Clones the project into a folder
git status : Checks the files that are not staged
git add index.html/-A/. : Stage the files
git commit -m "Added index.html" : Will commit the files but not push it into the repo.
git push : push files into repo
git pull : pull files from repo
git : shows all git commands
git branch name : create a branch
git branch : shows all branches
git checkout branch : select and work on that branch
git merge master : To add changes to your branch from master

If you git commit without a message, it gives you an error. To get out of that press Esc and then type :wq
Git pull request is used to make a request to someone that pull my file and check if it is ok. If it is ok, then merge it into master
